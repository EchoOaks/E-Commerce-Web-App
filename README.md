> Web application called `Famms` Is A Platform to Sell Products Online. In This Project I Created Web Application Using Angular Framework And [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) which is Fake store rest API for e-commerce or shopping website prototype. I created this web application, based on a [Html Design]() website design and distributed by [ThemeWagon](https://themewagon.com).

### Project In Progress ⚙️

####  To be clear, the images in this website are of people that do not exist. They are not real, they are from a site that offers images of fake people AI generated. The names are also fake names.

#### To visit the web application: [Live Preview](https://omar95-a.github.io/E-Commerce-Web-App/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
